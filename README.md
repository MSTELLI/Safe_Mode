# Safe_Mode
#Machine learning algorithm for safe mode project

--> In this machine learning project,
we used Liner regression
to test the car's safe mode according to the data we received from sensors in a car.

--> We used the p value elimination method on the
liner regression model.

-->All the code, data file, and p value within the project are individual results of elimination.
